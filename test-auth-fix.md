# Authentication Fix for App Store Endpoint

## Problem

The `/api/v1/projects/app-store` endpoint was returning `req.user` as `undefined` for logged-in users because it was configured as a public route without authentication middleware.

## Root Cause

In `projectRoutes.ts`, the app-store route was placed before the `router.use(authenticateJWT)` middleware, making it a public endpoint that couldn't access user information.

## Solution

1. **Created Optional Authentication Middleware** (`optionalAuthentication`):

   - Checks for authentication token if present
   - Attaches user info to `req.user` if token is valid
   - Continues without error if no token or invalid token
   - Perfect for endpoints that need to work for both authenticated and non-authenticated users

2. **Updated Route Configuration**:
   - Applied `optionalAuthentication` middleware specifically to the app-store route
   - This allows the endpoint to show star status for logged-in users while remaining accessible to everyone

## Files Modified

- `backend/src/middleware/auth.ts` - Added `optionalAuthentication` middleware
- `backend/src/routes/projectRoutes.ts` - Applied optional auth to app-store route
- `backend/src/controllers/projectController.ts` - Removed debug console.log

## Expected Behavior After Fix

- **Non-authenticated users**: Can browse app store, see projects without star status
- **Authenticated users**: Can browse app store, see projects with their personal star status
- **Star functionality**: Now works correctly in both app store listing and preview mode

## Test Instructions

1. Start backend server: `cd backend && npm start`
2. Open app in browser: `http://localhost:4200`
3. Test as non-authenticated user:
   - Navigate to App Store
   - Should see projects without star indicators
4. Test as authenticated user:
   - Log in/register
   - Navigate to App Store
   - Should see projects with star buttons and correct star counts
   - Try starring/unstarring projects
5. Test preview mode starring:
   - Click "Try" on any app store project
   - Should see star button in preview header
   - Star functionality should work correctly
